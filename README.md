# PERSIMUNE GitHub

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub of PERSIMUNE! It hosts various research projects, code repositories, and resources related to our ongoing research efforts. Through this platform, we aim to foster collaboration, share knowledge, and contribute to the advancement of science and technology.

## Naming Protocol for GitHub Repositories

As a part of maintaining a well-organized and easily navigable GitHub repository space, we have established the following naming protocol for each repository:

### General Naming Guidelines

1. **Major Standalone Projects:** For any significant standalone project, there are no strict naming restrictions. You are free to choose a descriptive name that reflects the essence of the project.

2. **Code Supporting Publications:** If the repository contains code that directly supports a single publication, please follow the provided naming templates based on the type of code.

### Code Supporting a Single Publication

For code repositories that serve to support a single publication, we use the following naming conventions:

#### Web Application Code

For code that deploys a web application associated with a publication, use the following naming template:

```
PAW[YYYY][Surname]__[TITLE]
```

- `PAW`: Abbreviation for "Paper Associated Webapp."
- `YYYY`: The year of the expected publication.
- `Surname`: The last name of the first author of the publication.
- `TITLE`: A short descriptive title with words separated by single underscores "_".

Example: `PAW2023Doe__Sentiment_Analysis_WebApp`

#### Non-Web Application Code

For code that is not a web application but is associated with a publication, use the following naming template:

```
PAC[YYYY][Surname]__[TITLE]
```

- `PAC`: Abbreviation for "Paper Associated Code."
- `YYYY`: The year of the expected publication.
- `Surname`: The last name of the first author of the publication.
- `TITLE`: A short descriptive title with words separated by single underscores "_".

Example: `PAC2023Smith__Data_Preprocessing_Utils`
